# MoodFlix – Mood Based Movie Recommendation System
# Project Description

MoodFlix is a frontend web application that recommends movies based on the user's mood. The application provides a cinematic interface inspired by streaming platforms and dynamically fetches movie data using the TMDB API.
Users enter their mood (e.g., happy, sad, romantic), and the system maps it to a corresponding movie genre to display relevant recommendations.

# Objective

To build an interactive frontend web application
To integrate a real-world REST API (TMDB)
To implement mood-based genre mapping logic
To demonstrate asynchronous JavaScript and DOM manipulation

# Technologies Used

HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
TMDB API

# Working Principle

User enters their mood.
JavaScript maps the mood to a predefined genre ID.
A request is sent to the TMDB Discover Movie endpoint.
Movie posters are displayed dynamically.
Users can click “Watch Now” to view movie details.
